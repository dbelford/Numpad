#Launchpad Remap

Shortcuts for apps, search, pages. just two keystrokes away.

Shorten the time between thought and action. Maybe making switching applications and contexts 
fewer keystrokes and thoughts will allow you to do more faster or do more complicated tasks. 

The idea is to make it one keystroke to launch the app and one or two keystrokes to get back out
of the app to where you want to be. Hopefully you'd be able to get to an app, to a website, or to
a search result in a learnable way.
